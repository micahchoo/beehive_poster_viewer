        This poster folds to create a square with shutters that open to a larger image inside. With the shutters closed, the outside of the poster resembles an old Spanish conquistador’s map
        of Mesoamerica. The map is a top-down look at the region and
        draws parallels between colonial history and modern-day capitalism. Outsiders who have no connection with the land have drawn this map, with motives of extraction and profit.

        <p>Mesoamerica is a cultural and geographic region that forms a thin land bridge (or isthmus) between North and South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans—making this region highly strategic for international trade. Due
        to its climate and geography, Mesoamerica is one of the most biodiverse
        areas on the planet.

        <p>Since the invasion of Hernán Cortés’ metal-clad armies in 1519, a long succession of foreign colonizers and transnational corporations have occupied and exploited Mesoamerica. Corporations and the U.S. State have referred to Mexico and Central America as their “backyard” since the early 1800s. Now with free trade agreements working to eliminate so many “barriers” to trade (like environmental and labor rights, industry is all the more eager to develop infrastructure in Mesoamerica to exploit the region</p>
        <p>In 2001 the president of Mexico and the Interamerican Development Bank introduced a plan to literally pave the way for implementing free trade policies. Named Plan Puebla Panama (PPP), the original plan included the southern states of Mexico (from Puebla) and the countries of Central America (to Panama). After fierce opposition throughout the region, the PPP underwent a public relations makeover and in 2008 was renamed the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project, or Project Mesoamerica. The plan now includes Colombia and the Dominican Republic.</p>

        <p>Project Mesoamerica consists of 8 initiatives to “strengthen regional integration and promote economic and social development,” but the bulk of the funding is going towards large-scale infrastructure projects for transportation, to increase “market competitiveness” by moving high volumes of commerce through the region. These highways, ports, and canals connect with factory zones, mines and resource extraction sites, and large-scale energy projects that power it all.</p>
        <p>These plans are unfolding in the context of the expanding War on Drugs, which has led to dramatically increased violence and further militarization of the U.S./Mexico border.</p>

        A hurricane of unnatural disasters rips through the southern hemisphere, devastating already marginalized communities and reminding us that we’re
not “all in this together.” Though industrialized countries in the global North are causing this climate chaos, the first and worst impacts of climate change are being felt by the global South. Governments and corporations are finding ways to profit from increasingly frequent severe storms and weather, a form of “disaster capitalism” that takes advantage of crises as
opportunities to push through their economic agendas.

        <p>Modern industrial cargo boats morphed with ships from the “Age of Expansion” sail across the map, some hauling away cash crops and others bringing imports.</p>
        <p>Three of these ships tell the story of the Triangle Trade of the late 1500s to early 1800s, the Atlantic Slave Trade circuit that relied on trafficking gold, sugar, and humans. Rum, made from sugar, was moved across the ocean to Africa and used to corrupt local leaders into facilitating the slave hunt. European colonists then shipped enslaved peoples to the sugar plantations in the Caribbean, where sugar was picked up and sent to Europe (and New England) to
        turn into rum, completing the triangle.</p>

The IDB relies on its finger-puppet governments to shake down the public

      The Department of Agriculture and the Bank join forces
      to push for individual land titles and credit to
      finance this dismantling of collective and Indigenous lands.</p>
      <p>In 1992, anticipating the signing of NAFTA, the Mexican government changed its constitution to allow for the privatization of communal lands; a decade later, Central
      American countries faced the same privatization
      with the signing of CAFTA-DR.</p>

        <p>After a long and hard season working her little hexagon plot, Farmer Bee brings her corn to market, but her corn doesn’t measure up.</p>

        <p>Free trade policies have opened the borders to dumping of cheaply produced corn from the
        United States, and Farmer Bee can’t compete with prices set by an open market flooded with grain from subsidized, large-scale agriculture.</p>

        Through

        <p>On the right side of the map,
        swarms of ants rise and fall
        in a cycle of resistance and repression. Troops force ants into
        a mass grave and firebomb their
        crops and villages, a direct reference to the scorched earth policy
        of the military dictatorship in Guatemala in the early 1980s, a genocide
        campaign that specifically targeted
        the Ixil Maya people.</p>
        <p>Guatemala’s civil war is emblematic of the entire region’s history, stemming from a long history of land grabs, inequality, racism, and U.S. intervention. Rising up from below, social movements continue to regroup and carry on struggles against militarization and for land reform, sovereignty, and justice, even when faced with the trauma of state brutality, mass arrests, and forced disappearances.</p>

        A tank-tractor merges the war machine with industrial agriculture, a new form of violence against people
        and the land. After World War
        II, factories that made tanks
        and explosives for war were put to new
        use and started pumping out tractors and fertilizers instead, leading
        to the world-wide Green Revolution and corporate control of agriculture. A mother stalk of corn is being assaulted and violated by the tank-tractor, sprayed with GMO seed and a toxic medley of chemicals.

        <p>Production of monocropped biofuels takes over huge swaths of land,
        depletes the soil, and contaminates water with fertilizers, while failing to address the consumption of fuel in the global North.</p>

        Below it all, the ants reemerge again as a symbol of popular resistance. While they are protesting at the top of the scene, here they are busy tending to the life cycle of corn that feeds and sustains their community: sowing and saving seeds, exchanging local varieties, and grinding corn into flour.
