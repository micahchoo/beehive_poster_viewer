    <p>Opening up the poster, the world on the inside is drawn from the perspective of an ant on the ground at the base of a towering ceiba tree. This ground’s eye view reflects the experiences of those who are rooted in a place and directly affected by the plans on the map. Between the roots of the ceiba, lively scenes illuminate stories of grassroots organizing and community resilience. This graphic documents many examples
  of alternatives to top-down development plans, highlighting resistance led by Indigenous peoples who have fought back against genocide and ongoing threats to their survival.</p>

    <p>The Ceiba tree’s spreading buttress roots hold the scenes together and tell an overarching story of rootedness. This tree serves as a gathering
    place, a beacon in the center of town that brings people together to share stories and announce calls to action.</p>

    <p>A multitude of characters symbolize strategies and tactics
    for building and defending autonomy. Every critter in the poster is based on a real species native to somewhere between Mexico and Colombia. 400 individual species of insects, plants, and animals give a glimpse of the incredible biodiversity of the region.</p>

      Two ghostly strands spiral down around the trunk of the ceiba. The creatures here are all extinct, endangered, threatened, or vulnerable, but in spirit they’re alive and fighting fiercely. The strands are interwoven like the double helix of a DNA strand, to show the interconnectedness of the whole web of life.

    The rainforest holds its richness in the upper layers of the canopy, which nurtures the life below. Once trees are cut down, the soil left behind is weak, and the ecological damage is irreparable. The loss of rainforests
    is mirrored by the loss of cultural heritage, which is also being rapidly fragmented and eroded.

  <html>In the top right corner of
the poster, power lines march over the horizon. Under construction since 2007, the electric interconnection plan (SIEPAC) lays the groundwork for powering factories and industrial infrastructure. Power lines that would ultimately stretch from
Colombia to North America particularly threaten the communities and ecosystems of the Darien Gap, a large stretch
of wetlands and forests along the border between Panama and Colombia where there are no roads (the only gap in the Panamerican Highway). While energy is generated to meet the demands of big business, some rural communities lack access to electricity for basic needs or face exorbitant rates. A mob of birds flies at the tower, knocking it down and re-wiring for energy on a local scale.

  <html>In the shadow of the power
lines, social spiders stitch together an urban squat as they
collaboratively rebuild their
community. Economic forces
have pushed them to the margins of
the city, yet they continue working together. Social spiders are not territorial or aggressive like many solitary species, but instead cooperate to build massive nests to care for their entire community. In the face of large scale development projects that threaten to uproot their new homes, the spiders are a reminder of urban struggles for land rights and recognition.

  transportation infrastructure, but these are highways being built for big industry, not for communities. Superhighways that claim to “connect Mesoamerica” are actually making large areas of land impassable for pedestrians and migratory animals, displacing homes and productive farmland, and charging high tolls that limit public use.

media into their own hands to build resistance movements, from small-scale distribution of pamphlets to bold takeovers of mass media, like in Oaxaca in 2006.</p>

      <p>A giant swarm of ants comes down the trunk of the Ceiba tree. The ants, like so many other little critters, play an essential role in the ecosystem. Scurrying beneath the dirt, they aerate the soil, making it possible for plants to grow, essentially laying the foundations for life on earth. While these ants seem small in the face of the entire forest, they outweigh all other animals and plants combined. The ants remind us that great changes are in the hands of the small and many. Working tirelessly, these miniscule creatures embody the phrase,
      la revolución es el trabajo de las hormigas (the revolution
      is ant’s work). Little by little, their collective work has the strength to achieve great transformations, which reminds us that together, we can create tremendous changes in the world around us.</p>

      <p>
        Some of the ants proudly
        carry messages from Indigenous communities in southern Mexico who have been slowly and steadily building autonomy for several decades. These sayings are Zapatista principles and also come from their experience of building “good government” councils, which encourage frequent rotation of leadership: “lead by obeying” the people in your community, they advise; “work from below, without seeking to rise to power;” “walk by asking questions.” Each ant is a different species, reminding us that the beauty of the world lies in its diversity - of cultures, of languages, of ways
        of being: “we are the same because we are different;” “a world where many worlds fit.” In the face of so
        many threats to the diversity of life on this planet, the ants converge at the base of the Ceiba to declare “Ya basta! Enough!”

      <p>As European colonists invaded Central America, they brought with them the invasive European honey bee, which aggressively began to push the native Mesoamerican stingless bees out of their ecological niche. Today, deforestation, pollution, and industrial farming are destroying habitat and causing the collapse of pollinator species all over Central America. Bees are an indicator species, and the drastic decline of their populations may forecast a larger ecosystem collapse. Restoring native bee populations is vitally important to the health of ecosystems and agriculture globally, and is directly linked to the survival of Indigenous peoples and beekeeping knowledge. Traditional beekeeping is an intimate relationship between bees, people, culture,
      and the land.</p>
      <h4>Vanilla and stingless bees</h4>
      <p>Pollinators and the plants they
      pollinate need each other. The
      native Melipona bee and the vanilla plant share one of these specific symbiotic relationships. Melipona bees from southern Mexico are the only natural pollinators of the delicate vanilla orchid. Without this specialized interaction, vanilla orchids would only survive by hand pollination, making vanilla one of the most labor intensive crops in the world.</p>

      Each terrace of the hive is buzzing as bees work on designing an economy to provide for their needs. As opposed to the accumulation of wealth that is central to the capitalist economy, this economy is centered around health, food, shelter and wellbeing. The Bees plan their economic system by studying the health and structure of their hive, taking notes, and mapping out routes for gathering local resources.

    <html>In contrast to the exploitative maps made by the colonizers, bumble bees, mason bees, and carder bees are mapping out a solidarity economy that is mutually beneficial. A bee on a conch shell phone busily takes orders while others prepare to send out bundles of heirloom seeds, honey, tortillas, candles, bee houses, and books, as part of a regional network that relies on local skills and goods.

      These bees have invited friends over for a meal and for a popular education workshop about direct trade. They explain how to connect with local farmers to get food straight
      from the farm to the table, cutting out the middleman. They use local bark to make DIY    biogas that heats the comal for cooking tortillas;
      next to it the same bark is
      mixed with honey to make
      balché, a traditional fermented mead.

      Bees work on dividing the hive, a skill passed down through the generations by oral tradition. The stingless bees are kept in a specially-made box, as the bee logs (stacked on the left side of this scene) are in short supply due to deforestation. Survival of Melipona bees depends on knowledge from elder beekeepers. In conservation efforts, some scientists with “zoo” mentalities have destroyed hives they tried to protect by collecting them for study in labs. The stingless bees remind
      us of the vital connection between culture and ecology.

      <p>The values of an extractive economy have led us to a mass extinction crisis and climate chaos. The holistic values of a solidarity economy are part of the antidote to this crisis. Like the bees, rebuilding local and regional networks can help us deal with the challenges and consequences of a rapidly changing planet. All the critters defending their land between the roots of the Ceiba are showing us the meaning of globalization from below: reaching out across borders, cultures, and generations to link movements and support each other’s struggles for survival.
